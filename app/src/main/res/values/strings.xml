    <string name="about_app_text">This app is dedicated to one of the most difficult topics in the English language - phrasal verbs.
                                  \nWe have included common phrasal verbs. You can read and learn them.\n
                                  The app has True/False questions. You can answer questions and get feedback if you answered correctly or not.
                                  You also have an interesting option to cheat to find the answer.
                                  \nAfter you have studied the verbs you can get a gift. The gift is a funny wish.
                                  \nEnjoy :)
